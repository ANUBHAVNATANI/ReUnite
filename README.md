# ReUnite
This app uses machine learning to help people find their missing kid.

# Inspiration
Over the years, our country has witnessed numerous cases regarding missing children and abduction.
Our aim is to take one step in this direction and solve some problems related to child kidnapping and missing.

# What it does
Our algorithm intelligently matches one image with others and detect whether they are same or not.

# Tech Stack
1. Android
2. Python
3. Keras
4. Pytorch
5. Flask
6. OpenCv

# What we learnt
We learnt advanced Machine learning and how to connect the big machine learning model to an android app. 

# What's Next
1. To Launch Android App on Playstore
2. To Improve Machine Learning Algorithm Accuracy
